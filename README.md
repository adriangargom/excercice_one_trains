# Problem One: Trains

The following project consists on my implementation for the first problem of the list

# Info

- All the input files used for testing are located in the `resources` package.

- The problem doesn't provide a way to store the data into the files, only mentions that you have to retrieve the data
from an input file, so I have used the following format to store the data inside the file:

```
    AB0
    BA1
    CA2
    .
    .
    .
```

- Also, it doesn't mention what you have to do in case that the input data is not correct, so I have thrown an exception
in case that the data format is invalid or there is any problem with the input file.

- Also, I have been testing the system uncharged of loading the input files with several input files and all the proposed
exercises with another graph that I have designed for ensuring that the proposed algorithms will work in other
test cases.

- All the test files have been executed and I have verified that work successfully.
